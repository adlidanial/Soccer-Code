Soccer Code - A Mobile Learning Games To Introduce Computational Thinking Skill Concept

Soccer Code is a mobile learning application that focused to introduce the secondary students based on computational thinking skill concept. The Soccer Code was the first of our team project under Diploma Final Year Project at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia.

Soccer Code was using Adobe Animate CC to develop the mobile learning application and it was using ActionScript as a programming language to add complex interactivity, playback control and data display in the mobile application.
